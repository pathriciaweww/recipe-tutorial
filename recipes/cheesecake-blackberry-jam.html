      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To make the cheesecake, preheat the oven to 150C and grease and line a
          22cm springform tin with baking paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the cream cheese and butter in a mixer and beat until smooth.
          Mix in the erythritol, then the eggs, one at a time. Miz through the
          sour cream, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest and 1 teaspoon of the lemon
          juice and the vanilla essence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the mixture into the cake tin and smooth the top into an even
          layer. Bake for 90 minutes until pale yellow on top and a skewer
          inserted into the middle comes out clean. Let cool for at least 2
          hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, to make the jam, place all the remaining ingredients into a
          saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and coook for at
          least 30 minutes, until thickened and reduced by nearly half. Stir
          frequently and break up the berries. Add more stevia to taste, if
          need, and remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool to room temperature and serve drizzled over the cake.</li>
